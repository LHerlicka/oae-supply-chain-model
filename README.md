# oae-supply-chain-model

This repository contains the optimization model and analysis framework developed as part of the [Project Name] (202Xâ€“2027). The model is implemented in Python using Gurobi and Jupyter Notebooks, and designed to assess near-optimal supply chain configurations for COâ‚‚-neutral production pathways.

> This repository is currently private and under development. The code and data will be made public after the end of the project (planned: mid 2027).
